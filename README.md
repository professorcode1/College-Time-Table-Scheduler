# **College Scheduler**

This is the software engineering project made by me as the semester 4 software engineering project. Its solves the common university problem of having to perfrom tedious scheduling.

To use this, follow the below steps.

- Git clone this repo
- Make sure you have node installed
- run `npm install` to get all the node modules
- have a mongod server on your local machine up and running
- run `node app.js` to run the application
- open any browser and goto `localhost:3000` to use the application.

It can be tedius to make your own dataset. So to use the dataset I used, the databaseClone folder has the entire database in JSON and BSON format. Use the following command in your linux terminal(with the mongodb server running) (you will need to have `mongodb-tools-bin` installed)
`mongorestore --drop -d collegeScheduler -c users /path/to/user.bson`.
Now use the username: raghkum2000@gmail.com and password:12345 to play with the thapar even semester 2020-2021 dataset(see the section_TT.pdf to see the bases)

Here's how the application works.

## Database

In the app.js file, only the logic for interacting with the database is written. It took 1200 lines total to implement the database queries. The database schema is as follows.

- A `user` constitues of 3 types of resources. `Professors`, `Rooms` and `groups`.
- Each resource can be assosiated ban-time. Times where said resource cannot have/be used for a period. Professor who need to go home early, rooms reserved for other periods. Lunch break of student groups.
- `User` also constitutes `courses` which are a combination of `professors`(those who teach it) and `groups`(those who learn it). A course is not useful for the generation of the schedule however it helps the user organise and query the data more easily.
- A `course` is composed of `periods`. A period can have a set-time i.e. when a period needs to happen. For example, egnineering drawing tutorial needs to happen on monday morning period 2 as that is the only time the patial professor is available. Also if you choose not to assign a set-time to a period, you can also assign ban-time's. These define when a period can't happen. I.e. manufacturing lab cannot happen before lunch as the students may pass out from hunger. You can also choose not to define either.
- If the `user` generates a schedule then said user also has one schedule object. The schedule is a JSON object that maps all periods to a number(day and time) such that they don't have any conflicting resources and don't break the contraints set by the set-time/ban-time.

The database queries should be done in the form of procedures and functions implemented inside the database(instead of in the application). I didn't know this when I made this project as it was long before semester four started and hence I didn't yet start studying DBMS. This is also why I used MongoDB instead of MySQL which would have been the far more sensible choise (226 out of the 1278 lines in app.js are so that resources can be deletes without compromising the database integrity. To have the same effect in MySQL the only thing that would have to be done was to include `ON DELETE CASCADE` for all primary keys in the schema of all the relations). At the time of this project I simply did not know SQL.

## Generate Schedule

Once a user goes to the `/generateSchedule` route, the user loads all their data (i.e. a copy of their entire database entry) as well as the js and wasm file that will be used to generate the schedule on their local machine. The file called scheduler.js is run in parallel as a web worker and given the users info. After turing all the information into a graph, it then calles the ant-colony.js/ant-colony.wasm which in turn the colors the graph. Once the graph is colored the front end sends the coloring as a post request and the backend updates the database. Now the user can view their schedule.

Here's how scheduler.js works

- For each period a node in the graph is initalised.
- For each professor an edge in initalised b/w all the periods taught by the professor
- For each group, an edge is initalised b/w all the periods attended by the group
- For each room an edge is initalised if the period takes place in that room.
- The number b/w \[1 , number of day * number of periods\] also have a unique node created corresponding to them. So say you the university operates for 8 hours and from monday to friday then for each number in the set {1,5 * 8} = {1,40} a node is initalised.
- For each set time an edge b/w all other times and the corresponding period is intialised. So if set-time is tuesday hour 5 for period p, then node 1 * 8 + 5 = node 13, then p will have an edge initalised for all nodes in {1,40} except 13.
- For each ban time the node b/w the time and the corresponding period is intialised. So if ban-time is friday hour 2 for period p, then node 4 * 8 + 5 = node 37 and p have an edge intialised.
- One last contraint is applied. The manufacturing lab is 3 hours long, which means that it cannot be started at periods 7,8 as this would mean that a part of the period will take place the next day. To account for this fact as well, edges are drawn b/w such times and periods which go over one hour. Lets call these edges the continuity constraint

Now to color the graph, the web-assembly used is actually compiled from C++ using emscripten. You can see the C++ code in the ant-colony-cpp folder.

The algorithm used is a minor variation of the algorithm proposed in the following paper. All credits for the algorithm goes to the authors of the paper.

A New Ant Algorithm for Graph Coloring - Alain Hertz and Nicolas Zufferey.

The minor variations are dicussed below

#### Variations in Problem Statment

- We already know the chromatic number with which we intend to color, so we start with it and reduce conflicts
- Certain nodes in the graph cannot have certain colors (the ban-time set-time contraint and the continuity constraint)
- Certain nodes needs to have consequtive colors (since lecture over one hour have a node for each hour)

#### Variations in implimentation

- When the ants are initalised. Every node get ants for colors viable to that node.
- When ants move,then only move from a node which considers their colors to be viable to another node which considers their color viable
- If a node is in conflict, all its sibling nodes (nodes corresponding to the same lecture) get recolored(with consecutive colors).
- In the sorting of moves, they are not just sorted via p(m,t) but rather first they are sorted via how much they reduce conflicts by and then in-place sorting via p(m,t) takes place. This might in an of itself make the algorithm worse, but measure taken to prevent that from happening is dicussed in the next point
- The selection of nodes in not greedy like the paper suggests, but rather probabalistic. After sorting every move has a rank (its index after sorting / total number of moves ). So the to select N<sub>l</sub>(x,t-1) moves we randomly generate an index. Now the probability that the move will be selected is given by e <sup>-500 rank<sup>2</sup></sup>. With this probability we select the move, or we discard it. We keep generating random indexes till we get theÂ N<sub>l</sub>(x,t-1) moves.This can create a deadlock situation if N<sub>l</sub>(x,t-1) is high while the number of moves is low but I never even came close to encountering it . This makes the selection almost greedy, only the top 10% actually get picked, but this method by my observation coupled with the above variation made the algorithm much better.
- pheramon update takes place after coloring has been performed(the paper suggests to do the phermon update before, which seems counter intuitive).
<br>
Even though the algorithm is single threaded, it never once took over 5 seconds to create the schedule (of thapar even semester 2020)
